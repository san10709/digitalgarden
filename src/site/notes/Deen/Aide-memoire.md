# NOTES
## From Quran
###### 1. 
   > Beware of a trial that will not only affect the wrongdoers among you. And know that Allah is severe in punishment.        8:25

This ayah is about the wrongdoers amongst the Muslims, and not about the kafir vs muslim case: an example of it is `Gazwa-e-Uhud` in which the archers who left their post turned the whole muslim army's win into a loss.
###### 2. 
`Zulm` means putting something out of its place.
###### 3. 
The four sacred months are: `Ziqada, Zulhijja, Muharam, and Rajab`.
###### 4. 
`Surah Al-Tauba` is also called `Surah Al-Bara` which means to disown.
###### 5. 
`Dajjal` means one who deceives and `Dajal` means to deceive.
###### 6. 
The reason why `Quraysh` used to send their children with tribal people for their `tarbiyath` is because the Arabic language was diluted in Mecca (where Quraysh was situated), for it being a trading center, and it was pure in the tribes.
###### 7. 
`Rukoo` is a division of Quranic verses based on their theme/content/topic: this makes it more appropriate than the `paarah` division.
###### 8. 
The ordering of the Surahs in the Quran is the same as in `Loh-e-Mahfooz`.
###### 9. 
Quran was compiled in the form of a book during the `khilafath` of Hazrat Abu Bakr and when Islam spread outside `Hijaz` during the `khilafath` of Hazrat Usman and different people started to read and compile it in their own dialects. To get rid of this, Hazrat Usman made only one version and destroyed all the other versions.
###### 10. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Lecture 4
`Mojiza` means `aajiz kar dene wali`.

One meaning of `Deen` is judgment that's why in `Surah Fatiha` we have `Malik-e-yom-aldeen`.
###### 12. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Lecture 5 at 19:30
`Iblees` means one who is hopeless.
###### 13. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 30 - 46) = 42:00

>Then Adam received some words from his Lord and He accepted his repentance: He is the Ever Relenting, the Most Merciful.
>-Abdul Haleem
>![[2-37.mp3]]

This verse confirms that Allah accepted Adam's repentance and that there is no concept of the Original Sin.

The purpose of the revelation of Surah Yousaf is to answer the question of the Jews who had asked through the `mushrikeen-e-Arab` that Abraham was in Jerusalem then how come the Jews (his descendants) were now in Egypt. 
###### 16. [EMAM](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoa3bHa8CL6GGpBgVDw_-iqaJvJ_Lbx5z&feature=shared) Lecture 158 = 38:00
The reason for the separation of Yousaf (and later on, of `Binyameen`) from Yaqoob was that Allah wanted to purify Yaqoob's `tawheed`: as he was becoming too much in love with Yousaf, and after his separation he tried to find Yousaf in `Binyameen`. 
###### 17. [EMAM](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoa3bHa8CL6GGpBgVDw_-iqaJvJ_Lbx5z&feature=shared) Lecture 158 = 55:00

>The brothers said [to each other], ‘Although we are many, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are–– our father is clearly in the wrong.’
>— Abdul Haleem
>![[12-8.mp3]]

Engineer translates `dalaalin` as being too much in love with someone/something as opposed to its other more common translation of `gumrahi`and he gives the reason that in this verse the sons of Yaqoob are saying this about their father whom they believe is a prophet, which means that they don't consider him to be `gumrah`.

This corroborates the proposition that everyone should read a translation of Quran (if they don't know Arabic).
###### 19. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 30 - 46) = 51:00

><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:15pt;">Yaa Baneee Israaa’eelaz kuroo ni’matiyal lateee an’amtu ‘alaikum wa awfoo bi’Ahdeee oofi bi ahdikum wa iyyaaya farhaboon</span>
>Children of Israel, remember how I blessed you. Honour your pledge to Me and I will honour My pledge to you: I am the One you should fear.
>— Abdul Haleem
>![[2-40.mp3]]
>

Dr. Israr says that Allah told `bani-Israil` that a prophet (Muhammad) will come and you have to accept him and they agreed to this: this is the pledge which Allah is reminding them of. At this time the Jews were in pretty bad position in the world (being persecuted by the Christians/Romans) and Allah says that if you honor your pledge with me (i.e., accept Muhammad as your leader) then He will honor His pledge with them (which is the glory in this world and the hereafter). 
###### 20. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 30 - 46) = 58:00

Allah is confirming that `namaz` is indeed a burden except for the humble. This can be taken sarcastically as well :) 
###### 21. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 75 - 107) = 27:00
Dr. Israr makes a good point about words that are used interchangeably but that have slight difference in their meanings: when only one of them is used in a sentence they they're synonyms, but if both words are used in the same sentence then their difference will be apparent. For example, Islam and `Eman`, `Jihad` and `Qithal`, `Muslim` and `Momin`, `Nabi` and `Rasool`.
###### 22. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 75 - 107) = 29:00
Dr. Israr says that a `Nabi` can be killed while a `Rasool` cannot be killed. For example, `Yahya` was a `nabi` and he was killed.

###### 23. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 108 - 141) = 22:00

This is believed to be the last verse revealed of the Quran.

Imran, after which this surah is named, is the name of two personalities in `bani-Israel`: the father of Moses and the father of Maryam (grandfather of Jesus) were named Imran. Dr. Israr says that the name of the surah is equally likely to either refer to the father of Moses or Jesus's grandfather.
###### 26. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 108 - 141) = 22:00

>Surely We created you, then shaped you, then said to the angels, “Prostrate before Adam,” so they all did—but not Iblîs, who refused to prostrate with the others.
>![[7-11.mp3]]

Dr. Israr says that this Ayath points to evolution since `khalaqnaakum` is plural (which he says could refer to a species) and then shaping means evolution, and then asked the angels to prostrate before Adam. He also mentions, I believe, some other verse which means that Adam was also chosen: which he connects with this Ayath and says that after the species was created and evolved then Adam was chosen from among them.

Note that this is for those people who neither raise their voices nor leave that place: their inaction is actually construed as a sin by Allah. That's why they'll be punished too.
This is corroborated by the below Ayath where Allah says that He couldn't send His punishment until the Prophet and the believers were among the disbelievers.

'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The one who was devoted to the Qur'an will be told on the Day of Resurrection: 'Recite and ascend (in ranks) as you used to recite when you were in the world. Your rank will be at the last Ayah you recite."' \[Abu Dawud and At- Tirmidhi].

Allah is short for `Al ilaha` which means `The God`.
###### 2. 
Only 5 ayahs are overturned in the Quran:
	1. The punishment of a woman who has committed adultery was initially to confine them in their homes and later it was changed to stoning to death.
	2. Heritage laws were initially not given, and left for the people to decide before they die, and then it was specified by Allah himself.
	3. Initially it was said that a muslim was equal to ten kafirs, and then it was said that a muslim is only equal to 2 kafirs.
	4. Changing of qibla.
	5. Progressive banning of alcohol.

   >"But once the Sacred Months have passed, kill the polytheists ˹who violated their treaties˺ wherever you find them, capture them, besiege them, and lie in wait for them on every way. But if they repent, perform prayers, and pay alms-tax, then set them free. Indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful."              9:5

   Note that Allah considers true repentance if one performs prayers after repenting.

As we know from psychology that we need something to pull us and something to push us in order get us moving, these two forces are provided in Islam in the form of Heaven and Hell. Engineer makes a good point of this pointing out that if we ask questions such as, "why did Allah create me against (or at least not including) my will? And if I don't follow his commands then He'll throw me in hell.", they will only make us afraid of such a god that does this but not love Him. And only if we look at the other side of this story where He'll make us mini-gods in Jannah can we fall in love with such god who does this.

Why do we recite `Bismillah` and `Allah akbar` while slaughtering an animal?
Because every living being's life is Allah's `amanath` so when we're taking it we begin in the name of Allah *implying* that He has created the animal for us to eat and only that's why we're allowed to take its life.

`Rasool` is a warner while a `Nabi` is not a warner (they merely correct the corrupted Deen of an earlier `Rasool`). And Allah doesn't allow a `Rasool` to be killed by his enemies; while no such guarantee is taken by Allah for the `anbiya`.

There has been only one instance of a `Rasool` warning about a punishment from Allah and after his people disbelieved in his warnings Allah still did not send a punishment; this is Prophet Younus (a.s.). This happened because the `Rasool` himself made a mistake and Allah gave his people its benefit. The details are as follows: whenever a `Rasool` comes to a group of people with a warning of an imminent torment if they did not become muslims (submit to Allah's will) then some become believers and others don't. And in Surah Anfal Allah says that until a Prophet and his followers reside in a group of non-believers Allah does not send His torment: He first extracts all the believers first and lastly the prophet from among the non-believers and then sends His promised torment (this is why our Prophet also waited for `wahi` to tell him when to migrate to Madinah which was almost after every muslim had already emigrated).

>![[2-30.mp3]]

How did the angels know that humans will spread bloodshed on earth? Dr. Israr gives two possible explanations:
1. There were `Jinns` before us and they had spread `fasadh` and that's why the angels extrapolated that to us.
2. Since humans were going to be given `khilafath` which would mean some authority that's why the angels deduced that they will misuse that authority; as the maxim goes, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
###### 16. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 30 - 46) = 15:00
In 2:31 when Allah teaches Adam the names of everything, Dr. Israr interprets this as Allah giving Adam the **potential** to learn everything physical (theory of everything so to say :). And with the passage of time we're just actualizing that potential. And this actualization will be finally complete with Dajjal who will bend the laws of physics according to his will: note that Dajjal will be born as a human in light of that hadith where the Sahaba suspected a newborn to be Dajjal so Rasool Allah went to verify.

###### 18. [EMAM](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoa3bHa8CL6GGpBgVDw_-iqaJvJ_Lbx5z&feature=shared) Lecture 160 = 40:00
Engineer makes a good point about why we should love Allah. He says that Allah shared two of His attributes with us:
1. Allah has existed from $-\infty$ and will exist till $+\infty$. He decided to create us, and although we didn't exist since $-\infty$, but we will exist till $+\infty$.
2. And in Jannah, Allah will share His other attribute of `Kun faya kun` with us.
Without taking these two points in consideration, one can either hate Allah (for putting them in such a big test) or fear Allah, but they cannot love Him.
###### 19. [Dr. Israr](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN5NkUdaF03i2YxYkzZxO3HjALil8_0Pi&feature=shared) Surah Baqarah (Ayat 142 - 176) = 58:00

>— Dr. Mustafa Khattab

This verse indirectly says that those who will go to Jannah will be purified by Allah before entering it: this is proof for the conjecture I had regarding the purging of someone who is wronged from the hatred or resentment they might have against who wronged them.

Since the banning of alcohol, fasting, and the heritage rules in the Quran were implemented in stages, can this be taken as an argument against cold turkey and in favor of progressive extremism?

>They ask you \[Prophet] about fighting in the prohibited month. Say, ‘Fighting in that month is a great offence, but to bar others from Allah’s path, to disbelieve in Him, prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and expel its people, are still greater offences in Allah’s eyes.

As we know that the divisions of ayaath is done by Allah Himself, the separation between these two ayaath is **probably** indicative of a hidden structure in the Quran since the second ayah is clearly part of the last sentence of the first ayah then why would Allah break a sentence in the middle? Or, maybe this division makes sense in Arabic language and not when it's translated in some other language.
The below Aayaath also corroborate this observation:

>\[Abul Ala Maududi] This verse covers a very wide spectrum of meaning. It emphasizes to the community of believers that wealth is one of the main supports of human life. It should not be left, therefore, at the mercy of those who are incompetent to handle it properly. By misusing wealth such people might destroy the bases of social and economic life and wreck the moral foundations of human society. The right to private property is not so absolute; if a person is incapable of exercising this right properly and if he might cause grave social harm by wanton expenditure then his right may be forfeited. The necessities of such a person’s life should always be provided for. But so far as the exercise of his proprietary rights is concerned, due restrictions should be placed on it in order that the owner is restrained from spending his resources in brazen disregard of the dictates of morality, collective welfare and economic interests of the community. According to the directive embodied in the verse, anyone who entrusts his property to someone else’s care should satisfy himself that the latter is capable of making good use of it. At a higher level, it is incumbent upon an Islamic state to take over the management of the properties of those who either lack totally the capacity for good management or cause social damage by misuse. In such cases the state is responsible for providing these people with their livelihood.

Yahya said in his Hadith: "And he said: 'O Jabir, why do I see you broken-hearted?' I (Jabir) said: 'O Messenger of Allah, my father has been martyred and he has left behind dependents and debts.' He said: 'Shall I not give you the glad tidings of that with which Allah met your father?' I said: 'Yes, O Messenger of Allah.' He said: 'Allah never spoke to anyone except from behind a screen, but He spoke to your father directly, and He said: "O My slave! Ask something from Me and I shall give it to you." He said: "O Lord, bring me back to life so that I may be killed in Your cause a second time." The Lord, Glorified is He, said: "I have already decreed that they will not return to life." He said: "My Lord, then convey (this news) to those whom I have left behind."

Abu Huraira reported Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as saying: Verily, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, would say on the Day of Resurrection: O son of Adam, I was sick but you did not visit Me. He would say: O my Lord; how could I visit Thee whereas Thou art the Lord of the worlds? Thereupon He would say: Didn't you know that such and such servant of Mine was sick but you did not visit him and were you not aware of this that if you had visited him, you would have found Me by him? O son of Adam, I asked food from you but you did not feed Me. He would say: My Lord, how could I feed Thee whereas Thou art the Lord of the worlds? He said: Didn't you know that such and such servant of Mine asked food from you but you did not feed him, and were you not aware that if you had fed him you would have found him by My side? (The Lord would again say: ) O son of Adam, I asked drink from you but you did not provide Me. He would say: My Lord, how could I provide Thee whereas Thou art the Lord of the worlds? Thereupon He would say: Such and such of servant of Mine asked you for a drink but you did not provide him, and had you provided him drink you would have found him near Me.

## From Other Sources
###### 1. 
We hear the idea very often that everything we do should be for Allah (not to disappoint Him or only to please Him), and I always wondered why? `Sahil Adeem` pointed out that this is because of love: if you love someone you do nothing to disappoint them and everything to please them. Then the question is why should we love Allah? To which Engineer has a very convincing argument.
###### 2. Conditional `Rizq`
I think `rizq` is conditional upon our actions/efforts: Allah has decided how much we "can" earn `rizq` (the upper bound), not necessarily, how much we actually get (due to our own inaction).
###### 3. Sun rising in the west
Near `qiyamath`, the sun will rise from the west (opposite of its current direction) this could be due to the reversal of Earth's magnetic field so that the north and south poles flip and hence east and west also flips.

**Q** = Engr. quoted a `hadith-e-qudsi` in which Allah says that, `"takabbur meri chadar hain. Jo is ko chede ga mein usko nahi chodoonga."` And we know the definition of `takabbur` from another hadith in which Rasool Allah defines it as, `takabbur haq baath se inad karna aur dusro ko haqeer janna hai.` Allah can consider everything and everyone `haqeer` compared to Him but Allah clearly doesn't deny the truth (as He is the truth) so how come `takabbur is His chadar`?

   > Allah has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers an everlasting stay in the Fire of Hell—it is sufficient for them. Allah has condemned them, and they will suffer a never-ending punishment.              9:68
   
**Q** = This clearly says that the hypocrites are permanently in hell. There is a hadith that says that if someone has the slightest hint of Iman in their hearts will eventually enter Jannah and people usually interpret it to mean saying the shahada once in their lifetime. The hypocrites also say the shahada so does that mean that this interpretation is wrong in light of this verse?

**P.ANS.** = The interpretation is for those who once embrace Islam sincerely/wholeheartedly and then become `amalan munafiq/kafir`.

**Q** = The verse 10:27 says that the punishment of an evil deed is its equivalent (`aik guna`), but there is another verse in surah `Araaf` where Allah says that the punishment of everyone going to hell will be doubled (`do guna`) and the verse 11:20 also says this same thing.

**Q** = Dr. Israr mentions three modes of Allah communicating with us:
   1. Putting something directly in their heart (`ilham` or `muhaddas`)
   2. Talking but in a veil (like He did with Moses and Prophet Muhammad on `Shab-e-Meraj`)
   3. Sending a `rasool` (an angel).
He says that only this third type of `wahi` (brought by Gabriel) is included in the Quran. Is this true?

**Q** = There is a verse in which Allah says that He revealed the Quran on `lailath-ul-qadr`, but we know that it was revealed over 23 years. Dr. Israr interprets this as Allah revealing the Quran from `loh-e-mahfooz` onto the first sky (or our Earth's sky) on `lailath-ul-qadr` and then it was revealed onto the Prophet over a course of 23 years. Is this interpretation correct? If not, then what's the case?

`Sahil Adeem` emphasizes that `Ardh` is more general than earth: it could mean planets. And in the first ayah Allah is saying that He created everything on `Ardh` for humans, and in the second and third Allah is stating humans to be the `Khalifah` of `Ardh`. So if we take the more general meaning of `Ardh` then that would mean that *everything* on *all* the planets is for humans. Is this correct to say? But from the last ayah we should conclude that `Ardh` means earth since we know that Adam and Eve came to this earth. So what's up?

Does this mean that lying by omission is also prohibited by Allah?
- I've heard a narration of the Prophet's migration to Medina in which when someone catches up with the Prophet and Abu Bakr he asks Abu Bakr who his companion was to which Abu Bakr replied that his companion was `hadi` (which means a guide): Abu Bakr sort of lied by omission and deliberately said something misleading. If lying by omission is wrong then did Abu Bakr err?

**Q** = Engineer says that the calf-worshipers were also forgiven and their execution was the acceptance of their repentance. But from Dr. Israr's tone (because he didn't explicitly address this issue) I reckon he thinks that they were not forgiven, and instead, their execution was the purging of the rest of `Bani Israel`. So the question becomes if they were forgiven or not?

**Q** = This ayah is in the context of the Jews resenting Gabriel for taking Allah's message and (by his own decision) giving it to Prophet Muhammad (from `bani Ismail` instead of someone from `bani Israel`). And Allah says in the previous verse that Gabriel did this by Allah's command. I was curious about Allah mentioning Michael: did the Jews had something against him as well? If not then why did Allah mentioned him out of the three remaining archangels?

**Q** = Dr. Israr says, in the context of requiring two female witnesses so that if one of them forgets then other can remind her, that although, men can forget as well, women are more prone to forgetting things because they're emotionally more sensitive and hence easy to upset Allah has made them more forgetful so that they're not pent up with that residual anger/bitterness/resentment. I wanted to know if women are indeed more forgetful.

**P.ANS.** = I think it's not obligatory: there are instances when `sahaba` were asked to do/say kufr but they didn't and were martyred. So I think it applies to `haram` food as well.

**Q** = Dr. Israr says that Allah is saying that He has explained His revelations in so many ways that the believers say to the Prophet, "you have really taught us (`dars dena` in Urdu)". But the translations say that the disbelievers say, "you have studied it from the previous scriptures". Which is correct?
**P.ANS.** = I think the translations are correct.

**Q** = Has any `sahaba` asked Rasool Allah about `haroof-e-mugatha'ath`? If yes, then what was his reply? If no, then is it not strange that the Quran is for us and we're not told the meaning of some parts of it?

**Q** = Dr. Israr says that the claim of the Pharaoh to be God and similarly `Namrood's` claim were only political claims: the law is what the Pharaoh says. And not in a divine and creator sense. I wanted to know if this is true?

>And to the people of Midian We sent their brother Shu’aib. He said, “O my people! Worship Allah—you have no other god except Him. A clear proof has already come to you from your Lord. So give just measure and weight, do not defraud people of their property, nor spread corruption in the land after it has been set in order. This is for your own good, if you are ˹truly˺ believers.

**Q** = When Prophet `Salih` said that a clear proof has come to his people he was talking about the she-camel. But when Prophet `Shu'aib` uses the same words, Allah hasn't mentioned what that proof was. So what was that proof?

>And We made the oppressed people successors of the eastern and western lands, which We had showered with blessings. ˹In this way˺ the noble Word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel for what they had endured. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people constructed and what they established.
>![[7-137.mp3]]

**Q** = Here Allah is talking about the Children of Israel getting freed from Pharaoh and being established in Palestine. Clearly Allah has used `Ardh` to mean a part of Earth. Is this a counter to `Sahil Adeem`'s claim that Allah uses `dunya` for Earth and `ardh` to mean general planets?

>![[8-43.mp3]]

**Q** = Although, Dr. Israr interpreted this decision by Allah to show the enemies few in number to the Prophet in his dream as Him showing only the true disbelievers and not those who they dragged along due to them being their masters or tied by kinship, I still find this disquieting: I think this is what could be called "lying by omission" . And Allah does not lie. So what's up?

>![[10-5.mp3]]

**Q** = Dr. Israr says that `diyaa` is used to for a light source while `noor` is used for something that shines by reflecting light (of something else): this is reflected in Dr. Mustafa Khattab's translation as well. In other places (I don't remember anywhere specific, but I'm making this assumption from common knowledge :) Allah takes about His `noor`: does that mean that His light is also a reflected light and Allah Himself is not a light source? Strange/stupid question maybe.

>When We give people a taste of mercy after being afflicted with a hardship, they swiftly devise plots against Our revelations! Say \[O Prophet], "God schemes even faster." Our messengers record all your scheming.

**Q** = Why is Allah calling these angels messengers: what message do they deliver?
**P.ANS.** = In another place we have a similar denomination for these record-keeping angels and there Dr. Israr interpreted that they'll finally tell a person about their deeds once they die, so that's the message they'll deliver.

**Q** = This is a statement by Moses (a.s.) to Pharaoh: but still, a point to ponder as to why/how Allah establishes the truth by His "words"?

###### <font color="red">16. Deception by Allah.....!?</font>
In the story of Prophet Joseph, he plants the king's cup in Benjamin's bag and then Allah owns this "plan". Is this not deception? If yes, then is it Allah's `sunnah` then?

# IDEAS
###### 1. Past!, Present!, Future?
Maybe Allah has perfect/absolute knowledge about our past and present but allowed the future to be unknown so that we may have free will.
He has fixed the death of a person and how much `rizq` they get over their lifetime: fixing the lifespan/death of a person doesn't clash with the above idea, but how a person gets their `rizq` is I believe intertwined with their decisions hence their free will. So fixing the amount of `rizq` might restrain their free will as well which would undermine the above idea.

>![[6-61.mp3]]

Dr. Israr says that these angels prevent untimely death of a person: I see this as evidence for my claim that Allah has allowed the future to be determined by our decisions, aka, free will. Otherwise, untimely death is impossible.
